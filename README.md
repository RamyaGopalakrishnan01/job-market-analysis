# Job Market Analysis â€” Data Analyst Roles

## Project Motivation
As a data analyst aspirant, I have always been curious to understand the current job market for this role.  
I wanted to know how competitive the market is, which locations have the most opportunities, and what salary packages are being offered.  
This curiosity led me to design this project.

I collected a dataset of Data Analyst job postings from LinkedIn and analyzed it to answer key questions such as:
- Which cities and locations have the highest demand for data analysts  
- Which industries and companies are actively hiring  
- What salary ranges are offered across locations, industries, and companies  

Through this project, I not only gained insights into the job market but also strengthened my skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and deriving actionable insights** from real-world data.
